C++ Module 09 | 42 LAUSANNE

Overview

This module covers advanced C++ concepts through three main exercises:

Bitcoin Exchange

Implement a program that reads historical Bitcoin prices from a file and evaluates the value of a user's input using those prices.

Handle edge cases like invalid input and corrupted files.

Reverse Polish Notation

Create a calculator to evaluate expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Ensure proper handling of invalid expressions or malformed inputs.

Ford-Johnson Algorithm

Implement the merge-insertion sort algorithm for sorting data efficiently.

Focus on understanding the complexity and optimizing your implementation.

Requirements

Use C++98

Compile with -Wall -Wextra -Werror

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/coolasfk/CPP09.git
cd CPP09

Compile:

make

Run the program:

./btc

Tips

Comment your code.

Test edge cases.

Use STL algorithms when possible.

Good luck!
